# Screenlogic HomeKit Accessory

## Usage

`./screenlogic-homekit -pin 00102003`

`pin` is the HomeKit pairing pin you want to use. The one listed above is the default, which will be used if you don't specify that argument.

From there, the accessory will show up on your network ready to pair.

I have only tested this on my ScreenLogic protocol adapter, with my pool controller, so I'm not sure what assumptions have been made that don't apply to other systems. That said, I've tried to keep it as generic as I could.
